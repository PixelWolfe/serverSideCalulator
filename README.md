# ServerSideCalculator

## Duration: 2 Day Sprint

  - ServerSideCalculator was a project I undertook at Prime Digital Academy over a weekend. I loved this project, it was an all around blast to create and I took it upon myself to learn and implement Bootstrap as into this as well.
  
  (Fun fact) You can look through INSTRUCTIONS.md file if you'd like to see the task I was given and the end result can be seen in the gif below or by setting up the project with the instructions below!

#### Personal Goals

  - My main goals with this project was to learn and experiment with Bootstrap. I took it upon myself to spice up the stylings to remind me of my own childhood and the many real life calculators I had been exposed to throughout those years.

  - Secondary goal was to make this application in a way that my girlfriend and I would be able to open it up on our phones and still have it be useable. This way we could send calculator words like '3110' and '1337' to eachother from across the apartment for fun.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Setup Instructions

1. Let's run some commands.
   * Run `npm install`
   * Run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:5000`

### Usage

A user may perform any basic calculation with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division and see the corresponding result upon hitting the '=' button. Results and the expression to obtain said result will populate above the calculator at this time.This calculator will prevent a user from performing many actions that would result in a NaN calculations such as

- using two operators back to back like `4 -+ 4`
- using back to back decimal points such as `2..0 + 3`
- using multiple decimal points within a single value such as `2.03.2 + 3`
- and more.

This version does not allow multiple expressions within a calculation.

### Built With / Technologies Used

  - PinDo was built using the following technologies:
      1. Node
      2. Express
      3. Bootstrap
      4. HTML
      5. CSS
      6. Javascript

#### Future Goals

  * These are some of the things that didn't quite get done in this 2 day project.

  * Clicking upon one of the finished calculations will autopopulate the result as the first input value for a new calculation.
